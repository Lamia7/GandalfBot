### Context
GandalfBot is a school project to practice the use of Python, Flask, JavaScript and APIs.

Ask him a question about a place and he will look for informations, Wikipedia URL and a map.

**Clone the repository from Github by running this command:**
```git clone https://github.com/Lamia7/GandalfBot```

Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` <br>
_Install all the libraries through the requirements file: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` <br>_
Run the application: `flask run` and go to your localhost : `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

(To deactivate the virtual environment, run this command: `deactivate`)

### How does it work ?
__(HTML)__ : User asks question on input and submit it <br>
__(JS)__  : gets (r√©cup√®re) this input <br>
__(JS)__ : makes a request to API route to pass it to back-end <br>
__(PYTHON)__ : API gets/retrieves the JS info  <br>
__(PYTHON)__ : API sends the request to Mapbox API <br>
__(PYTHON)__ : API recieves coordinates with response from Mapbox API <br>
__(PYTHON)__ : API sends the request containing coordinates to Wikipedia API <br>
__(PYTHON)__ : Wikipedia API gives the response to my API's request (description and URL)<br>
__(PYTHON)__ : API recieves response from Wikipedia API <br>
__(PYTHON)__ : API sends the response to front: JS <br>
__(JS)__ : sends response to HTML <br>
__(HTML)__ : shows reply

### Features üìã
